Argovis Hackathon 2022

Group 2, subgroup 2: slices of gridded products

Co-Leads: Monica Nelson and Danielle Lafarga (Python proficient)

Group members:
Ivana Escobar (Python proficient)
Samuel Mogen (Python proficient)
Weiqing Han


Objective: Creating 2D slices of the ocean state from 2D/3D gridded fields (see demo notebook for gridded products)

Data:
Roemmich and Gilson product for temperature
Kuusela and Giglio OHC product (maybe)

Subgroup 2
Maps/movies of gridded fields
E.g. near-surface temperature anomaly to show marine heat wave hot spots
Spatial and temporal average in a region
Regional seasonal cycles 


(Subgroup 1
Slices along longitude, latitude, depth, or any section and time (interpolating)
Argo profiles versus gridded products)
